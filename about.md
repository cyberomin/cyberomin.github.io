I'm a Software Engineer currently living and working in Africa.

I currently work at Andela, a $41M VC-backed startup. Andela provides companies with access to the top 1% of tech talent across the African content.

Prior to Andela, I worked at Konga, a $78.5M VC-backed e-commerce marketplace. Konga is the largest online marketplace in Nigeria with well over 20,000 merchants.

While at Konga, I served as the lead engineer for [SellerHQ](http://shq.konga.com) and online marketplace platform for Konga's over 12,000 stores and helped in migrating some of the company's monolithic applications to mirco services. 

I lead the development of a [community forum](http://community.konga.com) for Konga's merchants and customers. This project has so far saved the company over $40,000 in annual licensing fee for an equivalent SaaS-based solution. The ideas and suggestions offered by the merchants and customer on this forum have greatly shaped the product roadmap and strategy of Konga.

I have also contributed significantly to the tech ecosystem here in Africa, for instance, I organised and convene [Africa Git Meetup](http://lagosmeet.github.io). Our most recent event had Kelvin Mutuma, a software engineer from GitLab as our guest speaker.

I'm the lead developer and maintainer of an experimental API for the Nigerian Stock Exchange. I am currently working on the same API for other African markets starting with the Ghana Stock Exchange.

I blog and share my thoughts about startups in emerging markets, with a special focus on Nigeria at http://cyberomin.github.io.
