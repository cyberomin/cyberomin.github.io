My dad and I were at the airport to pick Nene, a former lecturer saw us and walked up to my dad and told my dad “your son was my boy, I trained him.” There and then I corrected the error, I told my dad he did nothing of such and he behaved like a demi-god. The man left speechless.

My dad was stunned. He didn’t see that coming. The lecturer was expecting praises. I spent the next 10min telling my dad how the said lecturer behaved like Jesus’ assistant. He made even standing in his presence a privilege. He never came to class nor held office hours.

You couldn’t even ask him questions and he will answer you. That man took joy in intimidating his students. People that boldly declared that no one was going to make a first-class. 5 shorts years later, he came to harvest where he never sowed. Receive undeserved praise.

If only Nigerian lecturers can see the future, or just behaved like decent humans, the life of so many undergraduates will be a lot different. I am very patient with most Nigerian graduates, I understand their pains. I endured the same.

To this day, I can only go back to my alma mater to say hello to 2 lecturers; Dr Eteng and Dr Arikpo. The rest don’t even deserve a good morning greeting. They did nothing to deserve it.

That said, come next year, I will be willing to teach 3rd & 4th year students of computer science at the University of Calabar. I will take care of my expenses and teach for about 3 weeks. This will be my own quota in helping these young people prepare for the real world.

If you know anyone that can help make this happen, please reach out.

Selah.

These people understand the power they wield, so they use it in an abusive manner. They punish you for just existing. A lecturer blatantly told me I will not pass his course because I didn’t buy his text.

That semester, I met my shiny “F” on the result board. It didn’t matter how much I prepared for his exams. The difference between me passing the course and repeating it was N750. I repeated the course.

That same lecturer became my project supervisor. He signed my final year project in a hotel room, flanked by 3 girls all drinking and puffing. Just before I left, he asked me to buy him drinks. I didn’t because I never had the money.

These men and women single-handedly destroyed the self-worth and the self-esteem of 100s of students. Do you know what would have happened if they had encouraged the 16/17 yrs old under their care?
Think about that for a second.

I remember the day I got my certificate, I went into a bathroom and wept like a baby, finally, the torments were over. I can look forward to something else. The baggage was finally lifted off my shoulder. After 11 solid years, I made a third-class - https://cyberomin.github.io/life/2016/11/07/chapter-three.html

In my quiet time, I pray for Sim Shagaya. That man gave me a life-changing opportunity. I will forever be grateful. Thank you, Sim.
