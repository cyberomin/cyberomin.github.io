Now, let me tell you a quick story. One night, the Holy Spirit pulled me aside and gave me a serious heart check.

See, I used to get really worked up over little things in my relationship. I’d major on the minors. One of those “minors” Nene (a.k.a. Management), and her habit of leaving her devices;  phone and watch, plugged in overnight.

Drives me crazy.

Why? Because I’ve always believed charging stuff overnight damages the battery. Plus, there’s the risk of power surges. It’s just been my thing. I’ve carried that mindset for as long as I can remember.

Anyway, back to this one Friday night. I was going to bed around 2AM (yes, I’m a night owl on Fridays), and I saw her devices plugged in. Again.

I was furious.
Not just mildly annoyed, fuming. Because:
 1. We’d talked about this.
 2. These were gifts I got her.
In my mind, I started telling myself stories:
“She doesn’t care.”
“She didn’t buy them, so she’s not bothered.”
“She’s ignoring my input.”

I wanted to wake her up. Right there. I had a full speech ready. But something in me whispered, “Let her sleep. You can talk in the morning.”

So I unplugged her devices, grumbled to myself, and went to bed.

Fast forward to the next morning. I wake up late (my regular Saturday thing), and I come downstairs to a scene straight out of a family magazine.

The kids were clean, fed, and watching TV. The house was spotless. Nene had made breakfast. Everyone was happy.

And as I walked in, she smiled at me and said: “Babe, you’re awake! I asked the kids to stay downstairs so they wouldn’t wake you. I know you slept late. Breakfast is ready, go freshen up, I’ve got everything covered.”

Whew.

As I turned around and walked back upstairs, the Holy Spirit hit me with this question, clear as day:
“Imagine if you had woken that woman up last night. Would you be walking into this peaceful home right now? Was all that joy worth sacrificing over two charging devices?”

That was the day I truly learned something:
Not everything needs to become a “thing.”
Not every irritation needs to become an argument.

Now? I don’t care if Nene plugs in the whole house. I just unplug everything before bed. In fact, it’s now part of my nightly to-do list.
Why?

Because it takes 60 seconds to unplug a charger.
But those same 60 seconds, spent ranting or arguing, could ruin a whole Saturday. Could hurt the woman I love. Could disrupt the peace in our home.
And for what?

Sometimes, we get so caught up in the one thing that bugs us that we forget the 99 things we absolutely love about someone. Their kindness, their laughter, their heart, the way they hold our world together without even trying.

So no, it’s not about the charger. It never really was.

Maybe for you, it’s the toilet seat. Or shoes on the floor. Or dishes in the sink.

Whatever it is, just breathe. Fix it. Let it go.

Your peace is worth more.
Your relationship is worth more.
They are worth more.

Happy Saturday. ✨
