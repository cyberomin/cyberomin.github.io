### Copy. Paste. Send. Voila !!! Not so fast.

Social media is a great place to be “the real you”. No inhibitions. Just be yourself. That sounds great and nice but it is not the whole truth. I am not saying that you should fake it or pretend but the same modicum of moderation that you exhibit in other facets of your life, should be applied here. Many have lost jobs, appointments, reputation by one careless
moment on the net. Some feel they can hide their identity, but in these days of hackers and breakers, anyone can get behind and get whatsoever information that he/she wants.

The normal educated person is expected to think things through and make

an informed decision. Afterall, education is the training of the mind. But it

seems these days, we have suspended that part of our existence. Any

sensational news travels faster than the speed of light without any

confirmation. I mean you have witnessed this. Let me re-juggle your

memory; remember the Ebola and salt solution. Even doctors were sending

and forwarding that message.

The wisdom of what I am writing about is simple. To put it succinctly, it

goes thus :Be careful when you are on the net. Things can be

tracked and most importantly; the internet does not forget. It

remembers and some things can embarrass you at moments you

least expect.

There are etiquettes on social media; written or unwritten. There are some

trends I have found and I want to say a thing or two about them. Here are

tips on some that I have thought of….

1.

Forwarded as received is not an excuse. When you forward things, it

means you believe them or the stuff forwarded reflects some of your

believes. Simply put, you forward stuff that you deem fit to be read by

others. That is what you readers think. Think about it, have you forwarded

conversations full of rake and libertine images to your kids or conversations

filled with invectives? You don’t because that is not your way. Please fact

check and consent to whatsoever you are forwarding. Do not forward stuff

that will make people question your morality, integrity, sanity, reputation

and faith. It is that simple. As my sons would say “Dad, I can do it. It is easy

pizzy, lemon squeezy”. You also can do it, because it is easy pizzy, lemon

squeezy. QED.

2.

Retweet are not endorsements: Easier said than what people think

about you after you have retweeted. Why should you retweet stuff that you

are not comfortable with? You are not under compulsion to retweet or

like/love a tweet. So when you say it is not endorsement, it makes one of us

think of you as schizophrenic. You get my drift. Retweet what you can stand

up for. You don’t need a PhD to understand this. Simple. Easy, pizzy, lemon

squeezy……Another QED.

3.

Always fact check information before you broadcast. I can’t say

more about this. Remember the Ebola and salt incident? Medical doctors

were spreading the salt solution stuff. Also the stuff that Buhari is going to

Islmamize Nigeria? Or that Bill Gates is giving out his wealth if you click this

and forward to 1 million people. Waoh. Unfortunately, we spread this news

like God sent it to us and we are the prophets to send it out to the world.

There is something that seems to be omniscience and competes with the

place of God these days. It is called Google. Please use it whenever you see

or hear anything and you feel like spreading it. Fact check on the internet.

Use Google. Google it. Do I need to say it again? Yes I will. Google it.

A wise proverb goes thus: “Dead flies cause the ointment of the perfume to

send forth a stinking savour; so doth a little folly him that is in reputation

for wisdom and honour”.

4.

Watch the video to the end before you send it out. I hardly watch

videos sent on social media groups (WhatsApp, Vine, Twitter etc), this is

because most times, people just send stuff out without watching it

themselves. It is like recommending someone that you do not know. Except

you are someone that I can trust with social media communication and

usage, I will not watch the video that you sent to me. It is the only way for

me to protect myself from seeing junk. I have been hurt once and so I do not

open myself to another episode. Please watch that video before you send it

out. Don’t put others in awkward positions. A great way to forward videos is

to write what the video is about after you have seen it to your intended

audience.

5.

Be careful of the jokes that you circulate around. Some are

downright offensive. Some jokes are funny but not religiously, tribally and

gender sensitive. It may be funny to you but offensive too the next person.

Again think through it.

6.

There is a world of difference between opinion and knowledge.

Think about it. Yes there is a difference and I am not the one to tell you that

difference. During the last Presidential election, I heard things from people I

held in high regards and shuddered. We had reasons to side whosoever we

took as our candidate but to run them down with unproven fabricated lies

was way down below.

From my experience especially with people in public office, I take most

comment and hearsay with a pinch of salt. I have met people who report

matters as if they were there but they were kilokitres (as Zebrudaya would

say), from the venue. They just circulate hand me down beer parlour stories.

We all have opinions on things but let us not circulate them as if you pull

them out of the constitution.

7.

Stop The Alarm. These days, I see alarmists everywhere. We just circulate

things. Oh see what they are doing to us in the north (pictures of the war in

DR Congo as shown as things happening in Nigeria. Some of those

grotesque pictures have been shown again and again), see what El Rufai

said. Ah they did not employ me because I am of my tribe (this same person

speaks with tenses that are at war with each other).

One dead fly makes the perfumer’s ointment give a rancid stench, so a little

folly can outweigh much wisdom.

All in all, what have I said ? Fact-check your news. Use Google. Be sure

before you broadcast.

Copy. Paste. Send. Voila ?????

Think again before you make that post.
