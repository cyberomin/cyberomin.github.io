<p>Today, 3 years ago, konga.com went live. This day has been permanently etched into my memory.
I wouldn't forget it in a hurry. I still remember the excitement, the frenzy while trying to deliver our first and only order for that day - July 10th, 2012. I still remember the customer's name, even that of the delivery man.</p>

<p>Those where the early days. No handbook to follow, no "Doing eCommerce 101" course to take. The management just had to follow guts and instincts. We have made our own fare share of mistakes we have also learnt from those mistakes. Back then, roles weren't that much of an issue. We all did everything. I mean everything. This, in itself isn't uncommon with startups.</p>

<p>Having been here for 3yrs and watch this baby grow, I consider this a blessing. The feeling is surreal.
I kind of have a sense of what fatherhood will feel like.</p>

<p>From a tiny little office along Sumbo Jibowu in Lagos, 3 years later we now have offices in Abuja, Port Harcourt, Cape Town and China and KExpress franchise all over Nigeria.</p>

<p>From 2 categories (Beauty and Personal Care, Babies, Kids and Toys) to over 20 categories today. Moving from a retailer model to a Marketplace model, pioneering innovative solutions like KongaPay to having the first ever community forum that foster transparency between, Konga, merchants and buyers.
This baby has indeed grown.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, the journey has only just begun. Like our CEO would say, we are on the first line of the first paragraph of the first page of an 800 page book.</p>

<p>So today, I say a big happy birthday to this baby, here's wishing you more awesome years ahead.
Happy birthday Konga.</p>
