Three months ago, I met the CEO of RoVedana and asked him to allow my nephew to come around his office and watch how work happened in the real world. The aim was simple, I wanted something that will occupy his time and kill idleness. Anything that will take him out of the house and limit his chances of getting into issues teenagers will usually find themselves. 

Thankfully, Lekan accepted, took him and the quickly found something for him to do. He became useful, earned his first pay and for the first time, had a taste of what it meant to work and earn a pay. 

This evening, his mum forwarded this article that he wrote to me. I'm not going to steal the young man's thunder, but to say I am blown is an understatement. I read the whole thing with a tears filled eyes.

How i got into UX design.
I had always been fascinated by any kind of designs, be it graphics designs, illustrations
and even cartoons — Still watch cartoons till this day—. I experimented with photoshop
and some things I learned off youtube. I completed my secondary school and found my
way to graphic design with a diploma in watching hours upon hours of youtube
tutorials. Although it was a little hard to keep up with all the commands and shortcuts,
it became very useful in my UX work later on.
While learning to use Photoshop, I also learned how to use Adobe Draw which wasn’t
as hard as I was expecting so I dumped photoshop for a while and made drawings
instead. One day I was asked to google and read about UI/UX Designs and I was
amazed by it and I wanted to be a UX designer since then.
My first job is as a product design intern and it has been good for most parts. When I
got here the design landscape changed a lot: UX design came into its own as a field.
Got to understand that what my uncle looks at all day is actually the backend of the
applications and websites I used every day (Coding).
Why I ultimately choose to specialize in UX design.
UX is much broader than what I did previously because it involves looking at all aspects
of the user’s experience. It’s about how the user engages with a product or a process,
how they feel about it, and how it fulfils or doesn’t fulfil their needs. When someone
asks me what I do while I'm waiting to get into college I usually say: “You know those
apps on your phone? I design those.” But that doesn’t really speak to UX’s full potential.
What I should say is: “Have you ever used an interface and found it an extremely
painful process? Well, I’m trying to rethink that process to make it easier for people like
you to use.”
I wanted the broader perspective that UX offered so that I could be part of shaping
product strategy. There is nothing worse than spending six months designing and
building something only to find that it doesn’t actually solve a customer’s needs or that
they can’t use it. As a UX designer, I am able to prevent that: I can conduct thorough
user research and user testing to ensure we create products that are actually useful to
our users.
What I thought was going to be challenging about UX
design, and the actual challenges.
Perfection is the enemy
When I first started out, I knew the big challenge was to make everything
“pixel-perfect”. We had to take time to create well-designed, polished, high-fidelity
mockups. I have to move fast — using wireframes and low-fidelity mockups — to learn
as much as possible, as quickly as possible. Now the challenge is to avoid becoming too
attached to my creations, so I can rapidly improve upon and, when necessary, discard
them.
My way for this is to release something I'm working on for testing long before I feel it’s
completely “finished” or “ready”. After all, the design is never “done”. You will always
be making changes and improvements — and that’s OK. It’s important to fall in love
with the process of rapid rerun and improvement, not the finished result. This way,
you’ll find a sense of accomplishment in your progress, even though the product might
not be “done”.
Accepting critique.
Another surprisingly big challenge turned out to be learning to accept critique. As an
intern, I found it difficult to accept that someone didn’t “like” my work or that there was
something “wrong” with my solution. I felt that, implicitly, they were criticizing me as a
person — that I must be really bad at my job. Consequently, I avoided soliciting
feedback as far as possible, out of fear for being hurt. But sometimes e dey pain sha.
Gradually, though, I realised that people were critiquing my work, not me and that this
was an opportunity for me to become better at what I do. What helped me was to
constantly remind myself that I am not the customer. I’m designing something for
someone else. That means that my own ideas are less important than the feedback and
critique I get from my users and my peers. I can’t create a better solution without it.
What has been most rewarding about being a UX
designer.
I haven’t really gone into the design world well but it’s extremely rewarding when I can
use UX design to make products and services accessible to people. This article
eloquently shows examples of how design can be used to do this.
At Rovedana in Lagos, my team and I are currently working on an app to make Payroll,
HR management and other additional features easier for a company. It’s rewarding to
see that I can contribute to that through UX design.
Resources
Books:
● Don’t Make Me Think by Steve Krug. This book makes design intuitive because
it’s super practical, witty, and easy to digest.
● Rocket Surgery Made Easy , also by Steve Krug. A great book to help you
bootstrap and “guerilla user test” your prototypes.
Articles:
● The Invision blog’s newsletter . Every issue has loads of articles on UX, as well as
career advice and insights from some of the top companies in the design
industry.
● I follow UX Collective and UX Planet for really great articles on UX, Product
Design and User Research.
● Behance has huge amounts of design inspiration, along with Dribbble . Great for
coming up with ideas.
Video tutorials:
● Learn UX are probably my favorite video tutorial of all time. Really informative
and gives tutorials on lots of different design tools, not just Adobe XD or Sketch.
They also cover a few topics on coding which I’m about to get into.
