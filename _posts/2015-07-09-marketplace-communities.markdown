December last year, I took up the responsibility to build an online community forum for Konga's over 12,000 merchants and customers. What really excited me about this project was that I had an opportunity to build a single channel that will consolidate all discussion needs for both our merchants and customers. I knew from the start that this was going a business redefining project.

Community forum for marketplaces aren't new &mdash; <a href="https://www.etsy.com/forums">Etsy</a>, <a href="https://ecommerce.shopify.com/forums">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/index.jspa">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://community.ebay.com/">Ebay</a> &mdash; all run their own forum. Why is this a big deal? In this age of social media, managing communication and passing information to a large number of people in a well structured and control way becomes a huge challenge. While sending emails are great, responding to individual complaints based off those emails quickly becomes an issue. This will require an entire team to handle this task. A forum fills this void. It offers a persistent way of sending across messages to a large number of people, both current and future users.

Trends noticed
We noticed that through this community, merchants can air their opinions, ask questions, find answers to challenges faced by other merchants/customers and give suggestions. When we launched self fulfil, one of the biggest request we got from merchants was a way to offer free delivery on an item(SKU) bases.
Our initial plans and concept was to offer this feature on a store level, but when we launched the merchants quickly realized that this wasn't going to work for them. They insisted that we provide this feature on a product basis. We did...boom, we had merchants recording increase in sales in the North of 300%.

The number of inquiries we had to deal with went down significantly as merchants and buyers willingly, on their own accord, proffered solutions to other merchants and customers.

Request for complimentary services like content uploading, copy writing and photography services grew significantly.

Where are we and the road ahead
The community, in such a short span, has grown to become and integral tool to both the merchants and customers and Konga as a company. No doubt the ideas and suggestions offered here will go along way in shaping the product road map of the company. New business strategies and services not thought of today will emerge from this place using the age old wisdom of the crowd. 

Ultimately, the tips and tricks, questions and answers, dos and don'ts that are shared here will go on to build an invaluable resource for both new and existing customers. This essentially will become our FAQ portal for all things marketplace.

eCommerce is a nascent industry in Nigeria and Africa at large. The only way to bolster this industry is to create avenues that will encourage transparency. Online communities, amongst other things, are one of the ways to bring the much needed support to this industry.

eCommerce is hard and it is even harder when you are building it in an emerging market like Nigeria. There isn't any blue print to follow, no manual. Nothing exist literally, without any doubt, one way we can and we will nail this is when we harness the collective knowledge of our customers, this can only be achieved when we offer them an avenue to express themselves.

In the end, we exist to serve our customers well. That is our sole mission. Our North star.

On the side, there are a couple of companies that can make use of community forum - Truppr, allow users to initiate conversation around fitness and health tips. Andela - Allow fellows and prospective ones to initiate conversations around technical questions and sharing their Andela experience.



Finally, marketplaces and communities aren't mutually exclusive. Socities thrive because of the healthy communities
we have been able to cultivate of the years. This ideology hold true for institutions alike.
