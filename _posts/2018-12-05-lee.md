Man, [it’s been a year since I last wrote to you.](https://cyberomin.github.io/life/2017/12/05/lee.html) It wasn’t a mistake, it was intentional. I don’t want to bore you with so much, my hope is that these letters will be meaningful to you in the years to come and they will provide a good backstory as to how we all got here. 

First, I have to apologize, it 3:56AM PST, I should have taken my time to write you something worthwhile like the king that you are instead of hurriedly putting this together. My sincere apologies. This week has been interesting. I will explain to you when I think you’re old enough to understand. 

So, what’s up? It’s been a year and a lot has happened. For starters, your footsteps are a lot stronger. Your gait is firm and steady. Last year this time, you could barely stand by yourself. Today, I have to chase you around the house and make you sit still. Boy, you run pretty fast and man, you’re a handful and I love it. 

Your meals are different now. You demolish a plate of garri and okoro. You still eat processed food though, but your garri expertise is second to none. You’re a true son of the soil, a true son of his father. Did I also mention your teeth are all coming together? This time last year you’d masticate your food with your gum. How time flies.

So now that you’re two, I have to tell you, you’re growing up quite quickly and I need to prepare your mind for what’s to come. Let’s begin with your sleeping habit, you will have to go to bed earlier now. Yes, you have to. Your 1AM - 10AM sleeping pattern has got to change. You will have to sleep by 8PM and wake by 7AM. You need to start acting responsibly now. 

You will need to move into your own room, oh, this one has to happen. Enough of struggling our bed space. We are not done yet, you are going to school too. You know what this means? You will become busy; assignments, cultural day activities, studying and meeting new people. I love the last bit, the people you will meet in this phase of your life may end up becoming lifelong buddies. While I am super excited about this schooling bit, I am worried I may miss some of your school activities; sports day, PTA, etc. But as long as time and chance permits, I’ll attend every single one of them. 

You will also begin a form of physical sports, we will begin with swimming. So, starting next year, we are going for swim lessons together. You see that car seat you very much hate? I have got news for you buddy, you’re so sitting on it all by yourself. No one is ever carrying you again. Don’t even argue or throw tantrums, you’re becoming an adult and adulthood comes with responsibilities. Chin up and deal with it. 

We are going to start earnest potty training too. I take responsibility for this one. I should have started you a lot earlier, nonetheless, you are going to start pooing like the grown-up that you are. Welcome to adulthood, son. 

We will have a more frequent father and some time now. The very moment you can string words together, bro, we are hitting the streets together. From movie dates to ice cream dates, you name it. We will do everything. Get ready. 

I’m going to get you a lot of toys now, like a whole lot of them. My belief is that you’re very much self-aware now and you can appreciate these things. The essence here is to allow you to explore so many things and pretty much begin to form an interest. I am not sure how this is going to go, but fingers crossed. 

The last 24 months has been amazing, your mum and I have made our fair share of mistake in trying to raise you, but as I promised you the last time, we always course-correct as fast as possible. It’s stressful and rewarding at the same time. I’ll never trade this experience for anything. If anything, it makes me appreciate your grandparents more. How in God’s name did they do all of this and still kept it together?

You have brought so much joy and happiness into our lives. Man, every day with you is a celebration, filled with so many surprises and we are grateful for this. A lot has happened in our own private lives; I changed jobs, I have grown older and I want to believe wiser too. Your mum quit the medical field to go pursue her passion in fashion. As you mumble your daily words, don’t forget to say a prayer for her. All around, there’s been a tremendous growth in every area of our lives. 

It has been all rosy man, we have had our own fair share of struggle. I have made a lot of mistakes this year, like a lot. I have run out of cash many times, like so many times. Those times have been some of the scariest moments because I worry I may not be able to meet up with my responsibilities as a dad. But through it all, God’s been good. How we manage to make it past those moments has been a mystery. 

>I am so sorry I'm not around to celebrate this special day with you, I'll definitely make it up to you.

As you go into this next phase of your life, I will repeat the exact same things I said last year; 

1. Work hard. There is absolutely no substitute for this. While there is such a thing as luck, but the harder you work, the luckier you will get. Put in the work.
2. God. Keep God at the centre of all you do. It's impossible to go through life without God.
3. Relationship. This is one of life's best gifts to us. Keep and maintain a healthy relationship with people. And when you get into one, don't abuse it. Don't take undue advantage of it. Seek to contribute more than you take. Don't become a parasite.
4. Fairness and Equity. Treat people first as humans, irrespective of their social standing. Be fair and just in all your dealings. Do unto them, what you will like to be done to you. I can't stress this enough, respect everyone.
5. Mistakes. There will always be mistakes. You will make them, consciously and unconsciously. But when you make them, learn from the experience and move on. Don't dwell too much on it. Never accept a pity party. NEVER.
6. Peer pressure. We will do our best to show you the right way, don’t deviate from it. Don’t let anyone make you do what you know doesn’t align with your values as a person. Be your own man.
7. Finances. Keep an eye on your finances. Always SAVE. You will always need it.
8. Emotions. Watch your temperament. I haven’t done much of a great job here myself, but thanks to your mum, I am learning a lot from her. When you get angry, watch what you say. Never let anger get the best of you. There are always consequences when you can’t put your emotions in check.
9. Passion. Follow your passion, this will be your one true source of happiness.

This last 2 years with you have been super amazing. It still feels like a dream. As always, remember your maker and never forget where you come from. I love you son.

Happy birthday, King.
Love, Dad.
