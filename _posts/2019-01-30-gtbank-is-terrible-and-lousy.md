> Banking can be defined as the business activity of accepting and safeguarding money owned by other individuals and entities, and then lending out this money in order to earn a profit. However, with the passage of time, the activities covered by banking business have widened and now various other services are also offered by banks.  The banking services these days include issuance of debit and credit cards, providing safe custody of valuable items, lockers, ATM services and online transfer of funds across the country / world.

According to the definition of banking above, GTBank isn’t safeguarding my money. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, let’s get into the meat of the story.

I have been a faithful Guaranty Trust Bank(GTBank) customer for over 10 years. Just like every young person in the late 2000s, the bank was one we all wanted to be associated with. The youthful vibe that the brand exuded drew me and many of my pears in. 

For context, I have only 2 bank accounts. The first account is with an old generation bank and the other one with GTBank. For the most part, the bank has served my basic needs; get money in and get it out. Pay bills using their USSD product, *737# and nothing more. We have had somewhat of a workable relationship.  

But in December 2018, I think that somewhat workable relationship stopped working 100%. Stay with me, I will come back to why this is the case. 

I, for one, think GTBank has grown so big - they once had best in class customer service which led to an explosive growth - and has lost its north star; from food festivals to fashion shows and web-series and most recently, music, they are trying to be everything to everyone. The bank is trying so hard to become a lifestyle brand and is missing it by a long shot. 

On the 22nd December, 2018 between the hours of 10AM and 4PM, I went to SPAR (operated by Artee Industries Limited) at the Calabar shopping mall to get my dad a Christmas gift. While trying to pay via the (First City Monument Bank) FCMB POS terminal at the store, the terminal returned an error message stating that the transaction was declined. I went out to the Diamond Bank ATM that was in the mall and withdrew cash, came back and paid for the item. On Monday December 24th 2018, GTBank debited me the sum of N36,457.67 and the recipient was ARTEE INDUSTRIES LIMITED.

When this issue occurred, I immediately reached out to the GTBank branch along Calabar Road, opposite the Central Bank of Nigeria and filled out the required dispense error form that same day, December 24th, 2018. A GTBank staff named Umah Abraka attended to me. She promise to log the complaint on the 27th of December, 2018.

<small>Umar Abraka letting me know she was doing me a favour by attending to me.</small>

When I returned to the bank on the 31st of December 2018, she claimed she couldn't log the complaint on the 27th of December, 2018 and informed me specifically that she had logged it on the morning of December 31st, 2018 just before I arrived the bank. When I reminded her about her earlier commitment to me, she told me in clear terms that she was “doing me a favour, considering the bank was going to work half day on the 27th of December.”

Between when the dispense error occurred and January 18th, I have been in constant touch with the social media team of GTBank via their Twitter handle. Every inquiry came back with a canned response - **“We are on it sir. We will get back to you as soon as we get a response.”** A month later, they are yet to get a response an as such, they are yet to get back to me. 

I reached out to a friend who knows a person within the bank to see if the issue could be resolved. My friend made introductions over email to 
Ugochukwu Ojiegbu, Uchechukwu Jewe and Mary Ndukew and the necessary information required to aid in resolving this issue were supplied. I exchanged a few emails with Ugochukwu Ojiegbu who was the main person that responded. 

On the 22nd of January 2019, I got this attached email from Ugochkwu Ojiegbu:

<small>Ugochuckwu response, letting me know the dispense error was never filed</small>

When I got this email, I was very upset. This is considering the fact I have waited for more stipulated 8 business days. I emailed them back and registered my displeasure about the service quality. The next email from Ugochkwu Ojiegbu was him telling me that he has escalated the issues to my account managers: Tom Onorieyereraye and Omolara Effiong. Omolara Effiong never answers her phone. Ever, I have called her a few times even before this incident and she neither did take nor return my calls. Tom Onorieyereraye on the other hand returned my call and promised to help resolve the issue. At the time of this writing, Wednesday 30th January 2019 2:18AM WAT, the issue is yet to be resolved. He also has joined the band wagon in giving me the standard “we are on it” reply. 

The GTBank brand is a big fat lie and here is why, the company’s mission states as follows
> We are a high quality financial services provider with the urge to be the best at all times whilst adding value to all stakeholders.

More than anything, my experience with them these past weeks has proven this mission to be just mere words and nothing more and for as long as they don’t uphold themselves to these words, they are lying to both their shareholders and customers at large.

What is even more annoying is their vision: 
> We are a team driven to deliver the utmost in customer service. We are synonymous with innovation, building excellence and superior financial performance and creating role models for society

If anything, their customer service is abysmal. The “excellence” they so much espoused is pure charade. Nothing is excellent about them. Because if they as much as cared about their customer’s, they wouldn’t let you come back to remind them about keeping to their SLA. As far as I am concerned, if Ms Umah Abraka had filed that complaint like she claimed she did, even though her colleague, Ugochukwu Ojiegbu, confirmed she never did, she should have checked back after the 8th business day to confirm it was resolved. 


The Central Bank of Nigeria has clear rules governing POS operations in Nigeria, according to this document published in August of 2011(https://www.cbn.gov.ng/cashless/POS_GUIDELINES_August2011_FINAL_FINAL%20(2).pdf), number 4.1, sub-number 4.1.15 states clearly:

>4.1.15 Merchant Acquirers(banks) shall in conjunction with banks, switches and other stakeholders ensure resolution of disputed transactions between the merchant and the cardholder within five (5) working days. All transactions from POS devices shall be routed through the PTSA to the relevant acquirer or its appointed third party processor.

It’s been **21 working days**, more than 4 times the regular period according to the CBN and this issue is still not resolved. 


For a second, let’s imagine this happened at a hospital, a place where either myself or a loved one needed critical health care, but my bank, the one I trusted with my money decided to disappoint me when I needed them most. Imagine I had no backup cash for a second, this would have been the most embarrassing experience considering I went to the mall with my dad and I had boldly declared to him “You can get whatever you want for Christmas.” Or imagine I was in another, and knowing that this was my last cash, I decided to pay for my airfare back home only to get a failed but debited transaction. I’d be stranded. 

I am genuinely worried that a bank with market cap of over a N1Tr, and one that has been in operation for more than 20 years can’t fix the smallest process as dispense error resolution and reconciliation.
