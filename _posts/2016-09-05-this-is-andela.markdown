There’s something about starting anew, it’s a gift. It’s an opportunity to apply the experience, knowledge and lessons gleaned over the years to a new journey, chapter and phase of a person's life. Most importantly, it as a blessing. 

A new start could mean different things to different people, to an artist, it could mean a blank canvas. One that new ideas will be painted on, ideas that probably came to limelight after he took a second look at his last artwork. To a writer, it’s a brand new page, untainted and waiting for him or her to pour out his or her thoughts. Write beautiful stories, stories that he probably left out in his or her last work. Stories that will go on to inspire generations yet unborn, stories that could change an entire course of history and add a little spice to humanity. 

Over the last couple of months, I have tried to share stories that are very dear to me and the were mostly centered around my work—technology and tech startups. On few occasions, I dabbled into [fiction](http://cyberomin.github.io/fiction/2016/04/10/the-dinner.html) and [life](http://cyberomin.github.io/life/2016/08/22/mama.html). Going forward, I will try to share about every other thing that interests me as an individual; art, life, work, etc. This isn’t for self-aggrandizement. This is for posterity. My children will someday read these stories. It will give them context.

Today marks the beginning of a new chapter in my life, a new opportunity, a fresh start. Today, I become an Andelan. I’m excited about the future, I can’t wait to see what it brings.

Thank you to Iyin, Nad, Jeremy, Ebun, Derin, Sayo, Seni, Lisbi and every other person that has been instrumental to the birthing of this new phase. I look forward to the amazing things that we all do together.

Let’s go make magic. This is ANDELA.
