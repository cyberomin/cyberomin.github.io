Every week, I see at least 10 tweets from job seekers asking for jobs. And every time I see these tweets, I think to myself, will I hire this person? These tweets, most times seek to be empathy based instead of value based. There's also an interesting pattern to these tweets and it goes thus - 
> "I graduated with first class in X. I am looking for a job. Please RT, my potential employer may be on your TL."

The first thing that comes to mind when I see this kind of tweet is why should I hire you? Should I just hire you based on the fact that you made the first class? I, for one, don't think that's a strong enough reason for me(as a potential employer) to make that hiring decision.

Today, I saw another of this kind of tweet and I decided to make a mini Twitter thread out of it. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Instead of saying &quot;I have a 1st class in X, please RT my employer may be on your TL.&quot; Why not say &quot;I&#39;ve experience in customer service. I took a team of 2 agents and grew it to 10 over a period of 12 months and during this time, we reduced complaints by 20%&quot;</p>&mdash; Celestine Omin (@cyberomin) <a href="https://twitter.com/cyberomin/status/1011601708248698882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2018</a></blockquote>

Let recap the thread in this post.

1. Instead of saying **"I have a 1st class in X, please RT my employer may be on your TL."** Why not say **"I have an experience in customer service. I took a team of 2 agents and grew it to 10 over a period of 12 months and during this time, we reduced complaints by 20%"**
2. **"We improved our SLA from 24hrs to 2hrs, thereby improving customer satisfaction and this had a net positive impact on our NPS."** You can also add your volunteering activities - **"I volunteered as the coordinator for our CDS game day. With a budget of x, we staged the best game day in our service year."**
3. **"I have an excellent communication skill - verbal and written." "I had also functioned in the capacity of a HOD when my manager was out for 3 months due to maternity leave."**

In the tips above, have you seen how I didn't mention a degree or its class? Instead, I focused on listing achievements and skill set. What you have just done here is to prove that you can bring something to the table. Honestly, these days, no one really cares about your 1st class. We have enough today. 

With what I described above, you have shown organizational skills, leadership skills and you have a firm understanding of stakeholders management. You have also proven to us that you're an independent thinker and you understand business metrics.

Bonus tip: Convert your resume into PDF and put it in a public Dropbox folder then attach it to your tweets. Make that resume short and engaging too. 

Good luck with the job search.
