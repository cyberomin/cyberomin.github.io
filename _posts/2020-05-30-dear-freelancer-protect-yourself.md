A few days ago, I wrote a post about how freelancers and clients should manage their relationship and be realistic about expectations. (Read it here)[https://cyberomin.github.io/tech/2020/05/26/dear-client-freelancer.html]. Today, I will talk about things freelancers can do to protect themselves.

It’s not unusual to have product features change during the development process.  This is common especially when new ideas are uncovered based on user research or changing market requirements or even regulations. Nothing unusual here.

Now, for this kind of request and if within reason, should definitely be accommodated. 

Let me explain, assuming you were building a simple calculator and a variable say interest rate was hard coded and somewhere along the line, it became important to make this configurable, such that if the market rate changes, the interest can be adjusted on the fly. By all means, this is a reasonable request and one that both parties should sit down, talk about it and consider.

This is a market driver requirement and it isn’t unreasonable.

But problem arises when an entirely new, not previously discussed, product requirements shows up. Then this isn’t acceptable. 

For instance, let’s say the application was supposed to sell cars, then mid development, the client now wants to offer loans to users.

Here is why this isn’t acceptable. The feature set for a car sales website is totally different. A typical app for car sales will have car images(carousel), car name, model, year, color, mileage, type, description, cost and possibly a button that you can make inspection request.

Loans on the other hand is a totally different beast. Feature include user verification(BVN), payment instrument for loan retrieval(card/account number), modeling for loan disbursements(how much money you can get based on some parameters).

Loan duration, loan default and penalties, arbitration, charge back, retries for failed charges, payment reminders, etc.

You see how this is now getting complex? So as a client, you can’t just drop this on the thigh of the freelancer just because you can. Recipe for disaster.

So how can freelancers protect themselves from changing requirements?

First and foremost, resist the urge to take on a project just because the money is “good” and you don’t want to lose a client.  Sit down and talk about the product requirements.

Document it, break it down into user stories if possible. Run this multiple times with your potential client and make sure both of you are on the same page.  

If your client is technical, run them by possible technology choices. It doesn’t hurt.

It will be more frustrating if they comeback a few months down the road and ask you to change tech choices because they will have issues with maintenance. 

Ask for their brand colour and assets if they have one. This important, do this before you begin the product design phase.

Don’t begin development until you’re done with product design, carry the client along while the product design is in process. If you can and I think you should, prototype the product.

This will give the client a good idea of what the end product will look like.

It will save you a lot of stress in future like “make the design punchy.” “The button doesn’t pop.” “Let the design be glorious.” “Can the logo fly from the left and the text slide in from the right?” 

Carry the client along and get a sign off for this phase.

Is it a slow process? Absolutely.  But it will reduce frustration in future.

When the sign off is gotten, then you can begin writing code. 

The above process is super useful if you’re using a flat fee billing method.  But if you’re using an hourly rate, then things are diff.

If for any reason, there is a disagreement in future with regards to deliverables, then make reference to the product requirements document(PRD). This is one easy way to keep your your development process streamlined and manage expectations too.

For the client, in other not to get disappointed when talking to the freelancer, try and be articulate with your product needs, be verbose and don’t just day I want to build “Airbnb.” It’s okay to use another product as a reference, but be clear on your own product features.

Spend time talking to other people, speak to someone technical, ask questions from your potential users. Ask features that will be important to them. Sketch out idle usage scenarios. Put in the work. The more work you put in, the less disappointed you will be.

Understand that the product you want to use as a reference took ages to build. So if you’re looking to build a super app, start with one feature, ship that and build iteratively.  

These has a couple of benefits, you will learn from real users and understand pain points

Freelancers, be transparent about cost too when putting together your initial doc. Most non-technical clients think the initial payment you both agreed on will cover the application hosting and maintenance in perpetuity.  Not their fault, educate them.

Let them understand that some cost are elastic and charged monthly(cloud infra), while some are charge annually(domain). 

Don’t ever top up any money for any external service. If you need 2 machines, get money for those two machines. Don’t lie, never LIE.

You’re better off charging more than trying to make a few buck by topping up on fees from SaaS tools.  

While estimating the product dev duration, make room for overflow. Don’t just settle for 3 months.

Ask for 4 months. This extra month will allow you deal with unforeseen technical issues.  Your client wouldn’t understand it, but you do and you need that time to deliver properly. 

Resist the temptation to take on more projects than you can handle. Don’t do it.

Lastly, charge for that initial product requirements doc. It takes time to put a proper and comprehensive product requirements document. 

Most clients will go quiet after getting that doc. You want to be compensated for your time and effort. You have earned it.

Oh, you’re better off doing a gig for free than undercharging. 

Undercharging has the potential to breed resentment when you realize the workload is a lot harder than you had earlier anticipated.  

Avoid the “help us, we are family/friends” syndrome.
