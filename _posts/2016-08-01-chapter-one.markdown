On a beautiful Friday afternoon, April 27th, 2012, I got a phone call from Sim and we spent the next 20 minutes or so talking about himself, myself and Konga. A few days later, 1st May 2012 precisely I was in Lagos to see him in person. 

We spent that evening at Colonades talking about Konga, commerce and why we all needed to go on this journey. On the 14th June 2012, I got a one-way ticket to Lagos and I haven’t looked back.

Over the last 4 years, I’ve had the honour of coming on this wonderful journey called Konga and the privilege to contribute to it. It’s hard to believe that it’s been 4 years already. I still remember my first day at work&mdash;excited, beaming with joy and a little bit naive.

In this 4 years, I have seen e-commerce grow and take a life of its own.

This month, I will be joining the Alumni network. I have had an awesome time here and also made beautiful  memories that will live with me forever. From DealDey’s borrowed office to [climbing poles in a bid to fix bad phone lines and sort out ISP troubles (I’m acrophobic)](http://cyberomin.github.io/startup/2016/05/08/employee-embrace-chaos.html), to our very first order, TGIFs, etc.

I still remember my first production application and the first git commit I made, first Yakata, etc.

I want to say a very big thank you to my soon to be ex-colleagues at Konga and everyone that held my hands through this journey, whip me back into line when I veered off course and most importantly being patient with me.

A big thank you to Tim Akimbo, he made the introduction, without him, I probably wouldn’t have been here, Effiong Okwong for helping me settle into this city that has become home. Ndifereke Ekott, Joseph Agunbiade&mdash;Alangoro&mdash; and every other person I must have left out. Thank you.

And to the amazing Lagos tech community, thank you for the love. Bosun Tijani, thank you for being awesome. God bless you.

I’ll love to take some time out and rest, possibly travel and plan the next chapter.

Celestine.
