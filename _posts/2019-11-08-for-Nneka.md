You see, there are people, then there’s your person, Nneka is definitely my person. Hold your horses, let me explain. Every day, as we go on with our lives, without our knowledge, God is always working miracles on our behalf and these miracles range anywhere from an answered prayer to delivering us from evil all the way to sending us our helpmate. 

A few years ago, Nneka walked into my life. I am certain about 30 or so years ago, God in the company of His angels had a meeting and decided if I must do all that He has destined me to do in and with my life, He must send a Nneka my way. He probably figured I will mess things up if this didn’t happen. So, Nneka being in my life was never a mistake. God does not make mistake. 

Tomorrow, we will be celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary. It’s hard to believe it’s been 5 years. I mean, I still remember the day I asked her to marry me - February 9th, 2013, I still have the receipt to that engagement ring. I still remember the shirt I wore. I still have the plane ticket I got for her on that trip. The memory is so fresh, it feels as though it happened about an hour ago. I wake up every day pinching myself, trying to convince myself that all this is real, that I am not in some alternate realm.

The last 5 years with you has been nothing short of amazing, if I had to do this again, it will be you. Cliche? Yes, but this is the truth. I have made my own fair share of mistakes. Like a lot of them, but most importantly, I have seen tremendous growth. Thank you for allowing me to learn on this particular job. For your infinite bandwidth that had allowed me experiment, mix and match, I say thank you. Without this opportunity, I doubt I will be half the man that I am today. So, thank you for being patient with me. You’re indeed a blessing. 

On our wedding day, just before we took our oath, you told me this will be a 100-year journey. So I guess, we will have 95 beautiful years ahead of us. 

Thank you for being an amazing mum to our little man, Lee. For the sacrifices and daily labour of love, I say thank you. It’s greatly appreciated. For being my biggest and number one fan, I say thank you. For constantly nudging and pushing me to go forward, I say thank you. 

Finally, thank you for being an amazing human. Here’s to the next 5 years…. Cheers and happy anniversary boo. 

Love always.
