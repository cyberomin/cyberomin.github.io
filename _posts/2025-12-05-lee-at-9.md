Dear Lee,

Happy 9th Birthday, my amazing boy! 🎉💙. 

Every year, I write you a letter on this day—part birthday tradition, part love note, part record of all the incredible ways you’re growing. And every year, I wonder how it’s possible for one little boy to pack so much brilliance, humor, and determination into just twelve short months.

But here you are again, outdoing yourself.

This past year has been a burst of progress—some big, some small, some loud enough to make me shout “THAT’S MY BOY!”, and others quiet enough to make me smile when no one is looking. All of them matter. All of them tell your story.

#### Academics: The Brain That Does Not Switch Off (Even When I Ask It To)

Let’s start with school. When you were awarded the All Round Best Student for your class and then Second Best Student in your entire grade, I stood there pretending to be calm, but inside I was basically doing cartwheels. You worked hard for it—not just with homework, but with your curiosity.

You ask the kind of questions that make adults reconsider their life choices:
* “Dad, what kind of toys did you play with growing up?”
* “If the Earth is round, why don’t we slide off?”
* “Dad, why are you always working?”

But your curiosity is a gift. And your achievements this year? Fully earned. Don't lose that hunger for knowledge, Lee. It will take you places.

#### Art: Watching Your Creativity Bloom

Your artwork this year has taken such beautiful steps forward. You paint with intention and emotion now. Your crayon strokes are confident, your colors are thoughtful, and your drawings tell stories only you can see.

And the way you sign your name at the bottom—like a little artist preparing for an exhibition—always makes me laugh. But deep down, I believe it. One day, people will look at your art and see the world through your eyes.

#### Swimming: From Fear to Silver Medalist

A year ago, swimming scared you. You’d stand at the edge of the pool like someone negotiating peace with the water.

But you kept trying.

Step by step.  
Breath by breath.  
Kick by kick.  

And then the day came when you weren’t just swimming—you were racing.

And you won the silver medal for your entire grade.

Seeing you touch the wall, look up, and realize you had won… that smile could have powered Lagos. It wasn’t about the medal—it was about courage.

You showed yourself what happens when fear meets determination. I am proud beyond words.

#### Cycling: The Great Bike Breakthrough

Your bicycle journey was another highlight. You started off wobbly, with me running behind you like an overworked backup dancer. But one day, with enough courage, you encouraged me to take off the training wheels, I hesitated, but you assured me you will be fine. I gave in and took them off. Then came that magical afternoon when I let go… and you kept going.

You didn’t even notice.

And when you finally realized you were riding alone, you shouted, “DAD, LOOK! I’M DOING IT!”

Freedom found you in that moment—and you embraced it with speed, joy, and slightly dangerous confidence (please brake earlier, my son).

Watching you cycle alone from our home to the estate gate and back was a proud dad moment I’ll never forget.

#### Sports: Your Football Era Has Officially Begun

This year, you really fell in love with sports—especially football. You kick, dribble, sprint, and shoot with a passion - both at home and in school - that makes me think you’re training for the World Cup.

And of course, nothing brings more comedy to our home than your endless arguments with Livy about football greatness.

The eternal debate:

##### “Cristiano Ronaldo is the GOAT!” — Lee
##### “Messi is CLEAR!” — Livy

The two of you go back and forth with the seriousness of seasoned football analysts—gestures, imaginary statistics, emotional speeches, everything. Sometimes I want to grab popcorn and watch the show.

I love these moments. They show your passion, your sense of humor, and your growing bond with your sister—even when you’re determined to win the debate.

#### Technology: The Young Engineer in the House

One of the things that amazed me most this year is your curiosity for technology.

You have this incredible ability to explore, experiment, and figure things out on your own. You investigate gadgets like a tiny engineer, poking around gently, pressing buttons, and testing ideas until you get the result you want.

The perfect example?

The day you figured out how to turn your tablet—and Livy’s—into a game controller so both of you could play football games on the television.

No adult help.  
Probably YouTube 

Just your brain, your curiosity, and your determination.

You connected the devices, synced them properly, set up the game, paired everything, and announced proudly:

“Dad, we made our tablets into gamepads.”

I stood there thinking, “How…? When…? Who taught you this?”
But that’s the magic of you, Lee—you don’t wait for someone to show you how. You explore until the answer reveals itself.

It’s a rare trait.  
A powerful one.  
And something that will shape your future in beautiful ways.

#### Kindness, Curiosity, Bravery… and the Right Amount of Sass

Of all the things you’ve achieved, what makes me most proud is who you are becoming:
* Kind, thoughtful, gentle.
* Curious, always exploring, always learning.
* Brave, ready to face challenges and try new things.
* A little sassy, which gives our home its daily dose of comedy.

These qualities make you special. These qualities will guide your steps.

#### As You Turn 9

As you begin your ninth year, my wish for you is simple:

Keep shining.  
Keep learning.  
Keep trying.  
Keep being the best version of yourself—kind, curious, brave, and full of heart.  

You are loved more than you can ever imagine.

#### A Blessing for Your Journey Ahead

I want to end with a verse that I pray guides you as you grow into a good, strong, loving human:

##### “Be kind to one another, tenderhearted…” — Ephesians 4:32

Kindness is a superpower.  
Carry it with you everywhere.  

Happy 9th Birthday, Lee.  
With all my love, always,  
Dad 💙🌟
