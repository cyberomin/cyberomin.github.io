If you have ever worked with RouteSMS' HTTP API, I am sure you probably have ran into this same issue. About 5 months ago, my company, <a href="http://konga.com" target="_blank">Konga</a> made the move to consolidate its messaging needs. This move was necessary as different projects had common needs and SMS notification was part of it. SMS notification is at the core of Konga.
</p>

<p> As a member of the team that was saddled with the responsibility of building a consolidated messaging/notification system, part of my responsibility was working on the SMS segment of the project. </p>

<p>We use RouteSMS, but unfortunately, RouteSMS does not have any official library for its API. This became apparent after spending a couple of hours googling for a suitable library.</p>

<p>I took it upon myself to write a simple library that will ease my pain of communicating with their API. Today, I'm making this public with the hope that someone else will find this useful.

<p>Here is the GitHub repo for the Python client library - <a href="https://github.com/cyberomin/RouteSMS" target="_blank">

<p>Here is the GitHub repo for the PHP client library - <a href="https://github.com/cyberomin/RouteSMS-PHP" target="_blank">

	PS: RouteSMS is an awesome company and I love their services. They are one of the most proactive companies I know.
