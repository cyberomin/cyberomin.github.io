If you have ever worked with RouteSMS' HTTP API, I am sure you probably have ran into this same issue.
About 5 months ago, my company, <a href="http://konga.com">Konga</a> made the move to consolidate its 
messaging needs. This move was neccessary as different project had common needs and SMS notification was part of it. SMS notification is at the core of Konga.
</p>

<p> As a member of the team that was saddled with the responsibility of building a consolidated messaging/notification system, part of my responsiblity was working on the SMS segment of the project. </p>

<p>We use RouteSMS, but unfortunately, RouteSMS does not have any official library for its API.
This became aparent after spending a couple of hours googling for a suitable library.</p>

<p>I took it upon myself to write a simple library that will ease my pain of communicating with 
their API. Today, I'm making this public with the hope that someone else will find this usefull
</p>
<p>Here is the GitHub repo for the library - <a href="https://github.com/cyberomin/RouteSMS">
