        <title>Technical job descriptions and movie hacking scenes</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&quot;Knowledge of database tools like(MySQL, PHP, Java and C#)&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&quot;8yrs experience building iOS apps using the Swift programming language&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often do you see job descriptions like these? I stumble on these things like every other day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s annoying about these job descriptions for technical roles is that there are most likely, if not often, written by people with almost no technical experience nor expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest misconceptions I have seen or hear about over time is the notion that software engineering or IT as a whole is something everybody and their mother can just pick up in a whim. This is nothing less than a big fat lie. You dont&amp;#39;t just pick up these things. You learn them, grow with them. There is a reason why people in technology are referred to as &lt;strong&gt;professionals&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every so often, companies allow the Human Resource department to come up with job descriptions based on the business needs, while there isn&amp;#39;t anything utterly wrong with this, it is also imperative that the said HR department needs to pass this job descriptions to someone in the technology department for proper vetting and sign off. Why ask for an 8yrs experience for a technology that has been around for a little over 2yrs? Where on earth are your prospective candidates going to come with the remaining 6yrs? Why do you classify a scripting language as a DBMS (databse management system)? This is wrong. Just wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a huge difference between programming/scripting languages and databases. Don&amp;#39;t even get me started on the different kinds of databases available today - RDBMS, NoSQL. PHP isn&amp;#39;t a DBMS. Period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theses same mistakes aren&amp;#39;t common to companies putting put job descriptions alone but to movie script writers as well. I once heard of these lines from a movie scene &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll create a GUI interface in visual basic, I&amp;#39;ll see if I can track an IP address.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;m sorry dear script writer, you missed this one by a very long mile. A long one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hkDD03yeLnU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every DevOps or Software Engineer that&amp;#39;s worth his or her salt knows you don&amp;#39;t need a GUI interface written in Visual Basic or any other language at that to track an IP. There&amp;#39;s a reason your OS has a terminal and that&amp;#39;s why log files exist. Explore the log with your terminal. That simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While organizations and script writers tend to come up with these things to make their organization and movies sound sophisticated and cool, they always often end up shooting themselves on the foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is my advise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
If you must write a technical job description, run it by someone who&amp;#39;s experienced in that field to help spot your mistakes. And refrain from looking for a generalists. They don&amp;#39;t exist, no one person is an expert in iOS and Android development, Web Application development, Server Administration, Database administration. Proficient in PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, Go, Closure, NodeJS, Coffee Script, JavaScript, CSS3. Like I said, he does not exist.At best, people have a fare working knowledge of these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear script writer, you can use the help of a real software engineer or tech professional. No point reinventing the wheel by writing your own &amp;quot;GUI terminal interface.&amp;quot; UNIX and all its contributors have done a great job for you already. Just use the tool. And those typing scenes(read as hacking)? The ones with the lonely guy in a poorly lited room? Make it more realistic, no one types that fast without even sparing a minute to catch a breath nor think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, technology, like every other profession has professionals and these are people that have spent years learning and perfecting their skills. It isn&amp;#39;t just about Excel, PowerPoint and Word. It is much more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Communities, the bedrock of marketplaces</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;com·mu·ni·ty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
/kəˈmyo͞onədē/&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;noun&lt;/em&gt;
noun: &lt;strong&gt;community;&lt;/strong&gt; plural noun: &lt;strong&gt;communities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

A group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;text-muted&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Konga has a healthy community&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I begin, I&amp;#39;ll like to state that communities are the bedrock of marketplaces. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December last year, I took up the responsibility to build an online &lt;a href=&quot;http://community.konga.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;community forum&lt;/a&gt; for Konga&amp;#39;s over 12,000 merchants and thousands of customers. What got me really excited about this project was the fact that I had an opportunity to build a seamless tool that will consolidate and facilitate all discussion needs for both our merchants and customers. I knew from the start that this was going to be a business redefining project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online community forums for marketplaces aren&amp;#39;t new &amp;mdash; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/forums&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecommerce.shopify.com/forums&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/index.jspa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://community.ebay.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ebay&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; all run their own forum. You may wonder, but why is this a big deal? I&amp;#39;ll explain. In today&amp;#39;s world, managing communication, passing information and gathering feedback from a large number of people in a well structured and controlled manner is fast becoming a huge challenge. While sending and receiving emails are great, responding to individual complaints based on those emails quickly becomes unwieldy. You will need an entire team to handle this task. This is where a forum shines. It fills this void. A forum offers you a tool that allows you tap into the minds of your consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cyberomin.github.io/assets/article_images/communities/announcement.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;text-muted&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://community.konga.com/thread/introducing-the-new-order-life-cycle-on-konga-mall&quot;&gt;An announcement. Forum users can&amp;#39;t comment. They only read.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of a community forum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
1.) Moderation is a lot easier&lt;br/&gt;
2.) You can make references to solutions for problems already solved&lt;br/&gt;
3.) Consolidation of messages is easier - you almost don&amp;#39;t have to police your users across other platforms. They know where to pour out their grievances in cases of gripe&lt;br/&gt;
4.) You own the platform, you set the rules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there exist platforms that achieve the same goal like a forum, Facebook groups being a classical example, a forum presents an uncluttered medium and helps your users focus on one single goal; share their experiences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting discoveries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Konga&amp;#39;s users, both merchants and customers had issues and legitimate ones at that. A community forum was long overdue. They needed to be heard. Merchants and customers openly air their opinions, ask questions, find solutions to challenges faced by other merchants and customers and they also proffer solutions to other people&amp;#39;s problems. &lt;em&gt;This platform, with almost no advertisement, took on a life of its own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we launched self-fulfil (a service that allows merchants deliver items by themselves, essentially bypassing third party logistics companies), one of the biggest request we got from merchants was a way to offer free delivery on an item(SKU) level. Our initial plan and concept were to offer this feature on a store level, our assumption was wrong. Merchants quickly realized that this wasn&amp;#39;t going to work for them. They wanted a way to indicate what item was eligible for free shipping. They pushed hard for this feature. We listened to them and gave them what they wanted, what happened next was really remarkable, merchants daily orders shot up by approximately 300%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cyberomin.github.io/assets/article_images/communities/free-delivery.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;text-muted&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free delivery tags on products&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of inbound complaints we have had to deal with has gone down significantly as merchants and buyers willingly, out of  their own volition, proffer solutions to challenges faced by other merchants and customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cyberomin.github.io/assets/article_images/communities/how-do-i-ship.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;text-muted&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inbound questions from merchants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Request for complimentary services like content uploading, copy writing and photography services grew significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cyberomin.github.io/assets/article_images/communities/photo.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;text-muted&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://community.konga.com/thread/i-need-a-konga-certified-photographer-in-my-area&quot;&gt;A photography request&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The community, in such a short span, has grown to become an integral tool to both the merchants and customers and Konga as a company. A tool that allows them express themselves. No doubt, the ideas and suggestions offered here will contribute in shaping the product road map of the company. New business strategies and services not thought of today will emerge from this place. This is the wisdom of the crowd at play here albeit we have had to deal with scathing remarks and criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the tips and tricks, questions and answers, dos and don&amp;#39;ts that are shared here will go on to build an invaluable resource for both new and existing customers and merchants alike. This essentially will become our FAQ portal for all things marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eCommerce is a nascent industry in Nigeria and Africa at large. The only way to bolster this industry is to create avenues that will encourage transparency. Online communities, amongst other things, are one of the ways to bring the much-needed transparency to this industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eCommerce is hard and it is even harder when you are building it in an emerging market like Nigeria. There isn&amp;#39;t any blueprint to follow, no manual. Nothing exist literally. Without a doubt, one of the ways in which we will build a formidable eCommerce ecosystem is when we harness the collective knowledge of our customers, this can only be achieved when we offer them a tool that can allows them share their experiences from interacting with our services. &lt;em&gt;In the end, we exist to serve our customers and merchants. This is why we come to work daily. Serving our users &amp;mdash; merchants and customers &amp;mdash; is our sole mission. Our North star.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the side, there are a couple of companies that can make use of community forums; Truppr, allow users to initiate a conversation around fitness and health tips. Andela - Allow fellows and prospective ones to initiate conversations around technical questions and sharing their Andela experience, Jekalo and Gomyway - Allow drivers and commuters to share their ride sharing experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, marketplaces and communities aren&amp;#39;t mutually exclusive. Societies thrive because of the healthy communities
we have been able to build and cultivate over the years. This ideology holds true for institutions alike.&lt;/p&gt;

Without a doubt, one of the ways in which we will build a formidable eCommerce ecosystem is when we harness the collective knowledge of our customers, this can only be achieved when we offer them a tool that can allows them share their experiences from interacting with our services. &lt;em&gt;In the end, we exist to serve our customers and merchants. This is why we come to work daily. Serving our users &amp;mdash; merchants and customers &amp;mdash; is our sole mission. Our North star.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the side, there are a couple of companies that can make use of community forums; Truppr, allow users to initiate a conversation around fitness and health tips. Andela - Allow fellows and prospective ones to initiate conversations around technical questions and sharing their Andela experience, Jekalo and Gomyway - Allow drivers and commuters to share their ride sharing experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, marketplaces and communities aren&amp;#39;t mutually exclusive. Societies thrive because of the healthy communities
we have been able to build and cultivate over the years. This ideology holds true for institutions alike.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Konga, the journey so far</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, 3 years ago, konga.com went live. This day has been permanently etched in my memory.
I wouldn't forget it in a hurry. I still remember the excitement, the frenzy while trying to deliver our first and probably only order for that day - July 10th, 2012. I still remember the customer's name(Kehinde LALEYE), even that of the delivery man(Moses GIMBA). Kehinde's first order were beauty products (&lt;em&gt;Voluminizing Mascara -XXL Black Lash and Waterproof Ultratenue Kajal&lt;/em&gt;) and that order came in at &lt;strong&gt;2:04:51 PM&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EATRiY19H0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those where the early days. No handbook to follow, no &lt;em&gt;&quot;Operating eCommerce in Nigeria - 101&quot;&lt;/em&gt; course to take. The management just had to follow guts and instincts. We have made our own fare share of mistakes, we have also learnt from these mistakes. Back then, roles weren't that much of an issue. We all did everything. I mean everything. This, in itself isn't uncommon with startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been here for 3yrs and watch this baby grow, I consider it a blessing. The feeling is surreal.
I kind of have a sense of what fatherhood will feel like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a tiny little office along Sumbo Jibowu in Lagos, 3 years later, we now have offices in Abuja, Port Harcourt, Cape Town and China and KExpress franchise all over Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2 categories (Beauty and Personal Care, Babies, Kids and Toys) to over 20 categories today. Moving from a retailer model to a marketplace model, pioneering innovative solutions like KongaPay to having the first ever community forum that helps foster transparency between; Konga, merchants and buyers.
This baby has indeed grown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, the journey has only just begun. Like our CEO would say, we are on the first line of the first paragraph of the first page of an 800 page book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, I say a big happy birthday to this baby, here's wishing you more awesome years ahead.
Happy birthday Konga.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Embrace mobile. Don't ignore it.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Mobile is the future, scratch that. Mobile isn&amp;#39;t the future, it is the primary screen.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The above quote sounds all too familiar, it is now cliché. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Africa, the millennial have leapfrogged the desktop paradigm straight to mobile. In a world where social media have been so woven into our social fabric, it is no surprise why these medium has become too important to be ignored. This, by no means, isn't an African thing alone. It seems to be a recurring decimal in the emerging markets with countries like China, India and Brazil scoring 21%, 55% and 28% respectively in new smart phone subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May this year, Mary Meeker, a Morgan Stanley analyst turned venture capitalist at KPCB (Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byers), further underscored this phenomenon when she pointed out that Nigeria is the most Internet mobilized country in the world with a staggering 76% Internet mobility with India and China trialling behind her.
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://cyberomin.github.io/assets/article_images/2015-07-05-embrace-mobile-dont-ignore-it/kcpb.png&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;text-muted&quot;&gt;Nigeria is leading.&lt;/small&gt;
    &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always held this proposition close to mind but I haven't quite grappled with its scale until recently. One of the products I very much care about is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://community.konga.com&quot;&gt;Konga community&lt;/a&gt;. It is my &lt;em&gt;baby&lt;/em&gt;. I popped open Google Analytics to see what was happening, I looked at every metrics and indicator available but one metric did catch my attention. Mobile. Mobile is killing it and it seems nothing can hold it back, not surprising though, but what particularly caught my attention was the fact that the mobile to desktop ratio was a staggering 63:38%. Now that's outstanding.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://cyberomin.github.io/assets/article_images/2015-07-05-embrace-mobile-dont-ignore-it/mobile_web.png&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;text-muted&quot;&gt;Ratio of mobile to desktop users&lt;/small&gt;
    &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria is a country of over 170M people with well over 140M mobile subscription, while all of these may not necessarily be smart phones, 16% of these mobile subscriptions are indeed...smart phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has well over 60M Internet users and the vast majority of these users are smart phone users. Going back to my earlier numbers with regards to the mobile to desktop ratio, it isn't any surprise while mobile reign supreme and will continue to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers however, goes to show why mobile should be taken seriously. In Africa and other emerging market, mobile isn't dessert. It is the main course&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Consideration when building for mobile:&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The vast majority of the mobile users in Africa and Nigeria in particular are still on the 2.5G network, very few MNO(Mobile Network Operators) offer full 3G coverage nationwide. So when building  keep speed at the back of your mind.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Mobile data is still expensive. 1GB data bundle retails for about $15 with a 30 days validity. So the less graphics and videos your users will have to deal with, the better UX you will be providing.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Graceful degradation should be at the core of your product development. Asking users to choose a mobile view while using your website just wouldn't cut it again. It should come naturally. Frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation already handle the bulk of the work for you.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Keep the call to action simple. Less clicks means less frustration. On the community for instance, you only have to tap one single button in order to start a conversation.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Make it magical. The vast majority of users that will be onboarded into this age(web and Internet) will come through messaging apps. There is a reason WhatsApp exploded, it just works. Simple.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    What does the future truly hold?
    I see a future where desktops would be used only in corporate institutions. Everything will be done via mobile; shopping, banking, bills payment. Virtually everything.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>RouteSMS over HTTP</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
If you have ever worked with RouteSMS' HTTP API, I am sure you probably have ran into this same issue. About 5 months ago, my company, &lt;a href=&quot;http://konga.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Konga&lt;/a&gt; made the move to consolidate its messaging needs. This move was necessary as different projects had common needs and SMS notification was part of it. SMS notification is at the core of Konga.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As a member of the team that was saddled with the responsibility of building a consolidated messaging/notification system, part of my responsibility was working on the SMS segment of the project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use RouteSMS, but unfortunately, RouteSMS does not have any official library for its API. This became apparent after spending a couple of hours googling for a suitable library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took it upon myself to write a simple library that will ease my pain of communicating with their API. Today, I'm making this public with the hope that someone else will find this useful.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the GitHub repo for the library - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cyberomin/RouteSMS&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
https://github.com/cyberomin/RouteSMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    PS: RouteSMS is an awesome company and I love their services. They are one of the most proactive companies I know.
    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; an advert.&lt;/em&gt;
